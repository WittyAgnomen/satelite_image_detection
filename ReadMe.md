## Overview

The current state of the code is very early. It only uses canny edge, dilation, and some naive area and perimeter measures to detect fields from satelite images. The eventual goal is to add corner detection (harris possiibly) to aid as a field detection measure. Also, want to add a streamlined process to tune the hyper parameters.
